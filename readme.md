## Background

**PARODY:** 
WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at **www.ALIENS-R-REAL.com** have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... Our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why I wrote code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](Data/data.js). It also allows our users to search through the table for specific pieces of information. There's a catch though... We only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.


* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, I've implimented JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns: 

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`


### Dataset

* [UFO Sightings Data](Data/data.js)

**Good luck out there!**
